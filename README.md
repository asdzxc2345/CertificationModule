The code implements a simple booking system for a bus service called "HighFly." It consists of two main user roles: 
passengers and cashiers.

For passengers:
They have options to sign up with their details (name, age, gender, password) or log in if they already have an account.
After logging in, they can book tickets, check the booking status, or return to the main menu.

For cashiers:
They need to log in with their credentials.
Once logged in, they can approve or cancel tickets booked by passengers.
The code maintains a list of passengers with their details such as name, age, gender, password, passenger ID, and booking status. Passengers can book multiple tickets, and their booking status changes accordingly.

Cashiers have the authority to approve or cancel tickets. When approving tickets, the available seat count is not updated, which is a logical flaw in the code.
Overall, the code provides basic functionalities for managing bookings in a bus service, but it could be improved in terms of code structure, error handling, and logical consistency.
